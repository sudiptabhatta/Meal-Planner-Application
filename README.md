### Part 1 - Authentication and Authorization

* Password Hashing with `scrypt`
  - Use Node.js's built-in crypto module to hash and compare passwords with scrypt.
  - The password must be hashed before storing it in the database.
 

* JWT with `jsonwebtoken`
  - After a successful login create a JWT that includes necessary user details.
  - Token should be sent back to the REST client and used in the Authorization header for protected routes.
    - Replace `user_id` in the header with Authorization using `Bearer` and the JWT token
 

* Middleware for Protected Routes
  - Create an express.js middleware function to check for a valid JWT
    - When the token is valid add the verified user details to the request object
    - Otherwise return a 401 Unauthorized error
   
      
### Part 2 - Database Integration with MongoDB and Mongoose

* Mongoose Schema + Models
  - Use the User and Mealplan Schemas and Models, including any virtuals.
 

* Add Any Necessary Hooks for Database Operations
  - Implement pre or post hooks in the User and Mealplan models as needed
 

* Update All Routes to Interact with Mongoose Models
  - Modify the functionality in the routes to use the Mongoose Models to interact with MongoDB for all CRUD operations
  - Remove all references to mock.js
 
    
### Part 3 - Layered Architecture

Update Homework 2 to use Layered Architecture by are creating lightweight routes, robust controllers and smart models. This ensures clear separation of concerns and maintains modularity.

* Update Architecture
  - Route files import only their respective controller
  - Controllers import only their respective models
    - If a controller does not have its own model but depends on another model to function, it may import the necessary model
* Models do not import other models (using the import statement)
